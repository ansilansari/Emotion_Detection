# 😊 Emotion Detection System — YBI Foundation Internship Project

This is my internship project for the **YBI Foundation**. The project is focused on detecting human emotions from facial expressions using Python, OpenCV, and a deep learning model.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a real-time emotion detection system that identifies facial emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, and Neutral** using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time webcam-based emotion detection
- Trained deep learning model using **FER-2013 dataset**
- GUI output showing detected emotions
- Clean and modular code

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**
- **Keras / TensorFlow**
- **NumPy**
- **Haarcascade Classifier**
- **Pre-trained `.h5` model**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The webcam captures real-time video.
2. OpenCV detects human faces using Haar Cascade.
3. The model predicts the emotion from the facial image.
4. The detected emotion is displayed in the video window.
